# Flask App README

This repository contains a Flask app that you can clone and run locally. This README will guide you through the process of cloning the repository and running the Flask app on your machine.

## Prerequisites
Before you proceed, please ensure that you have the following software installed on your machine:
- Python (version 3 or above)
- pip (Python package manager)

## Clone the Repository
To clone the repository to your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Change to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
3. Run the following command to clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/vikreth/lstm_flask.git
```

## Set Up the Virtual Environment
It is recommended to set up a virtual environment for this project to isolate its dependencies. Follow these steps to create a virtual environment and activate it:

1. Change into the project directory:

```
cd <project-directory>
```

Replace `<project-directory>` with the directory name of the cloned repository.

2. Create a virtual environment:

```
python -m venv venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

- For Windows:

```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

- For macOS/Linux:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Install Dependencies
Once you have activated the virtual environment, you need to install the project dependencies. Run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the necessary packages to run the Flask app.

## Configure the App
Before running the Flask app, you may need to configure it based on your needs. The configuration options are typically found in a file named `config.py` or similar. Make sure to update the configuration according to your requirements.

## Run the Flask App
To run the Flask app locally, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you are still in the project directory and your virtual environment is activated.
2. Run the following command to start the Flask development server:

```
flask run
```

3. By default, the app will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`. Open a web browser and navigate to this URL to view the app.

## Conclusion
You have successfully cloned the repository and run the Flask app on your local machine. Feel free to explore the code and customize it according to your needs. If you encounter any issues or have questions, please refer to the project documentation or contact the project maintainers.
