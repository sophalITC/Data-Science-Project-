Sure! I can help you with Dockerizing your Flask application. Docker is a popular containerization platform that allows you to package your application and its dependencies into a lightweight, portable container.

To Dockerize your Flask app, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Dockerfile**: Create a file named `Dockerfile` in the root directory of your Flask app. Open the file and add the following content:

```
# Use an official Python runtime as the base image
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements file into the container
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install the required packages
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the entire app directory into the container
COPY . .

# Expose the port on which your Flask app will run
EXPOSE 5000

# Set the command to run your Flask app when the container starts
CMD ["python", "app_lstm.py", "--host=0.0.0.0"]
```

2. **Create a requirements.txt file**: In the root directory of your Flask app, create a file named `requirements.txt` and list all the Python dependencies required by your Flask app. Each dependency should be written on a separate line. For example:

```
Flask==2.0.1
```

3. **Build the Docker image**: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the root directory of your Flask app (where the Dockerfile is located), and run the following command to build the Docker image:

```
docker build -t flask-app .
```

This command tells Docker to build an image using the Dockerfile in the current directory (`.`) and tag it with the name `flask-app`.

4. **Run the Docker container**: After the Docker image is built successfully, you can run a container based on that image. Use the following command:

```
docker run -p 5000:5000 flask-app
```

This command tells Docker to run a container based on the `flask-app` image and map port 5000 of the container to port 5000 on your local machine. Adjust the port mapping if your Flask app listens on a different port.

That's it! Your Flask app is now Dockerized and running in a Docker container. You can access your app by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:5000`.

Please note that these instructions assume you already have Docker installed on your machine. If not, make sure to install Docker Desktop or the appropriate Docker tools for your operating system before proceeding.
